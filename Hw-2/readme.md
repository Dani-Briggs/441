## 441 readme HW-2

I did pretty well on this asssignment. Once I looked at the video lectures, I knew what I was doing. I did have one little problem though. Everything was working fine but the console.log wouldn't show up and I didn't know why. Turns out instead of putting it in the script tag, I put it in a style tag and that's why it wasn't showing up. Besides that, I didn't have any problems with this asssignment.
