## 441 readme HW-1

This assignment was difficult for me. I took Creative Coding but not Web Design so some of this was new to me. Once I  looked at examples and w3 schools website, I started to get the hand of things. I had some trouble with the hero image. The image wanted to work outside the hw-1 folder and not inside the folder as it should be.
