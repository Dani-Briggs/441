## 441 readme HW-1

This assignment was difficult for me. I took Creative Coding but not Web Design so some of this was new to me. Once I  looked at examples and w3 schools website, I started to get the hand of things. The hero image didn't like to work when it was in its own folder so, it's with the index and readme. At first, I didn't know if you wanted the website to be on the first index.html you wanted us to make or make a new one, but after I was done stressing out about it, I looked at other people's examples and figured out what to do.
