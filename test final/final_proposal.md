# My Proposal

My idea for my final project is to create sound visualizer. I'm going to recreate either 8-bit or very simple versions of album covers from my favorite band, Muse, and have either the actual songs playing in as the sketch is being created or 8-bit covers. The songs will be from the album that it's from so, the song will change as a new sketch is being created. I would love to all 8 albums, but that is probably too much for me so, I'll limit myself to my 3 favorites. If I can do more I will, but for now my goal is 3.

My inspiration for this is the other sound visualizers from the past examples, and an old project I did in my highschool coding class, where we created a drawing only using squares so, the drawing looked like an 8-bit character.

I'm going to need to figure out how to put audio in my sketch and how to get to change to a different song too. I know I should use classes, but my luck with them have not been great and I'm going to need to deal with that, or make my sketch very, very organized.

I'm going to start with just drawing the sketch first in p5, then focus and add the movement and then the music. I'll also set a schelechue for how much I work on the sketch, and make sure I don't overwork and stress myself too much.

The first thing I'm going to do is figure out how I'm going to do the audio for this and then start drawing the first album.
