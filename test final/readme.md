# Final

## Summary

So I was originally going to do more than this, but my proposal seemed a little more diffcult than I thought it would be. So, instead of three album covers and songs, there's only one cover and song. The sketch also doesn't bulid on screen. I was able to make some from of a sound visualier though. So, now it is a 8-bit sketch of an album cover that plays plays a 8-bit version of a song.

## Steps

First, I looked up how to get music play. Thankfully, Dan Shiffman has a whole video series on sound in p5. Those series of video also taught me how to do the visuals as well. I drew a simple sketch on paper see what my sketch might look like and then I started drawing it in p5. After that, I started working on the sound visuals.

## Disscusion

I wouldn't mind a Disscusion on sound visuals because I had a lot of fun with it.

## Problems

I problems on movement and my song not playing. The song not playing was because I wasn't using a local server.  I didn't get much help on the movement so, I had to get rid of it.

## Helping Others

Didn't get a chance to help.
