## 441 readme HW-8

This assignment wasn't too bad. The problem I had was time and that's my fault. I try to do most of the techincal stuff. I made sure I had shapes, Images and text. All of those elements are atleast doing something when the button is pressed. The only problem I had with the code was a spelling error.
