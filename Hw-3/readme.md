## 441 readme HW-3

I had fun with this assignment. I took what I learned from the first assignment and appiled it to this one for the background and text. I chose a zomblie adventure because I was watching someone play the new Resident Evil game. I thought it would be a fun and easy thing to do. I didn't really have any trouble with this assignment. I wanted a space inbetween the choices, but the only way I figured out how to do that was to create another document.write with an empty space inside. So, there's probably a better way to do that, but that's what I came up with.
